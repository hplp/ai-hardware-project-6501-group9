## Project Title:
Driver Drowsiness Dectection System on Nvidia Jetson Nano


## Project Description:
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano aims to provide accurate, real-time alerts to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. It will leverage efficient, optimized models to detect key drowsiness indicators—such as prolonged eye closure, blinking frequency, and yawning—while ensuring timely response through auditory or visual warnings. Designed to operate effectively within the constraints of the Jetson Nano, the system will demonstrate smooth performance with minimal lag and power efficiency. Additionally, it will be robust enough to handle real-world conditions like varying lighting, driver positions, and potential occlusions, making it suitable for reliable use in practical driving scenarios.



## Key Objectives:
- Build a real-time drowsiness detection system on Nvidia Jetson Nano platform.
- High detection accuracy and reliability.
- Efficient use of edge computing resources.

## Technology Stack:


Hardware platoform: Nvidia Jetson Nano.

Software tools: JetPack SDK (CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT), OpenCV, dlib, Pytorch.

Language: Python, Shell.

## Expected Outcomes:

Achieving accurate and timely detection of drowsiness indicators, triggering alerts with minimal delay to warn the driver effectively. The system should run efficiently in real time on the Jetson Nano, handling continuous video processing within its computational and power limitations. Additionally, it is expected to be robust enough to perform reliably under various real-world conditions, including changes in lighting, driver posture, and partial face occlusions, making it a viable solution for real-world deployment.
